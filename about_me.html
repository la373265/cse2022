  <p>My name is Lorena Alvarez and I'm a junior at Santa Ana High School. Computer Science Essentials is the first Project Lead the Way (PLTW) course I've enrolled in. Despite it being a course designed for 3rd year PLTW students, my persistence and skills have helped me keep up with the class. Other STEM courses I'm enrolled in are AP Calculus AB and AP Environmental Science. Although I've always enjoyed my STEM courses at school, Computer Science is the field I want to pursue in the future as a Software Engineer. As for my hobbies, during my free time I like to read, spend time with friends, and go on bike rides.</p>

  <tr>
    <td id="CSE"> I decided to enroll in Computer Science Essentials because the summer before my junior year, I became interested in coding. CSE seemed like a great opportunity to learn more about coding and how those skills can translate in a work environment. I will continue on the PLTW pathway here at Santa Ana High School because it will give me a headstart to what I will learn in college. </td>

<!-- You should take Computer Science Essentials because this course teaches you fundamental skills, like web development and navigating different operating systems. If you see Computer Science as your future, CSE is a great course to enroll in. You will work with hardware and software to complete various projects. Even if you don't want to pursue technology in the future, CSE is still a good course to take because you will learn crucial technological terms. -->
